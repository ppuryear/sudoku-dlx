sudoku-dlx
======
`sudoku-dlx` is a simple sudoku solver written in C. It uses a fairly direct
implementation of Knuth's
[Dancing Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) algorithm, as this
project was mainly written as an exercise to help me learn about DLX and exact
cover problems. Thus, there are probably faster, more efficient sudoku solvers
out there if you are interested in such things.
